## About
I am a biologist with a Masters degree in Physiology, in which I developed a
little Flash software to teach neuroscience concepts to young adults. I have to
admit I had more fun programming and creating content for the software then
doing my actual research. After a few years working with science books editing,
I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently working as a Web
Developer and creating educational content at [Campus Code](https://campuscode.com.br/).

You can take a look at my Masters dissertation [here](https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/41/41135/tde-18022009-132437/pt-br.php).
