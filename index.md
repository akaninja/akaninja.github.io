## About
I am a biologist with a Masters degree in Physiology, in which I developed a
little Flash software to teach neuroscience concepts to young adults. I have to
admit I had more fun programming and creating content for the software then
doing my actual research. After a few years working with science books editing,
I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently working as a Web
Developer and creating educational content at [Campus Code](https://campuscode.com.br/).

Here is the first game I made, in 2006 in Macromedia Flash just for fun: [Bubble game](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/348846).
